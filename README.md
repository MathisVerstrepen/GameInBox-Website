Main site of a Minecraft survival server. <br />
> State: **Online - no longer updated.**

## Goals

My goal with this site was to allow players on our Minecraft server to have a kind of hub to follow the progress of their statistics throughout their adventure.

## Features

- Track the history of the number of connected players.
- Monitor server performance (tps).
- Keep track of all the basic statistics of each player (number of blocks placed, distance covered, etc.).
- Create rankings for some statistics to add a competitive side to the game.
- Track the progress of vanilla minecraft achievements and custom achievements created for the server.
- A panel listing all shops and items available for sale on the server with their prices and total quantities sold.
- A clear list of players with for each one a page summarizing all their data.
- A page with all the useful documentations (rules, plugins orders, etc).
